# tests/__init__.py

# This file marks the 'tests' directory as a Python package.
# This allows test runners like pytest or unittest to discover
# and execute tests defined in modules within this directory.

# It is often kept empty.

# If you had test-specific helper modules or base classes within subdirectories
# of 'tests', this __init__.py would allow them to be imported relative
# to the 'tests' package.
# For example, from tests.helpers import some_test_utility

# pytest users might define shared fixtures in a conftest.py file
# within this directory or parent directories.
