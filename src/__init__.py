# src/__init__.py

# This file can be intentionally left empty.
# Its presence indicates to Python that the 'src' directory
# should be treated as a package, allowing you to import
# modules from it.

# Optionally, you can use this file to:
# 1. Execute package initialization code.
# 2. Define an __all__ variable to specify what gets imported with 'from src import *'.
# 3. Make submodules or specific classes/functions available at the package level for convenience.
#
# For example, if you have a key model class in 'src/model_architecture.py':
#
# from .model_architecture import FruitVQAModel
#
# And if you want to control 'from src import *':
#
# __all__ = ['FruitVQAModel', 'some_other_utility_function']

# For now, keeping it simple and empty is fine.
